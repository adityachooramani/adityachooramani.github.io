      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello Readers,
This is my first ever attempt of writing a Blog so there might be some grammatical errors and I also don&rsquo;t know the basics of blogging so I apologise in the beginning.
I don&rsquo;t have some very crazy stories to write here in my blogs(or maybe I have;) but the motive of me starting this blog is to certify my skills and record my journey of growth ðŸ“ˆ</p>
<p>Before going on any further let me tell about myself, If you might not know yet my name is Aditya Chooramani, I am currently in my second year of college pursuing BCA(Bachelors in Computer Applications). I am very fond of computers and technology and this was my motivation for pursuing this degree and moreover i like cybersecurity very much because firstly it as a kid I wanted to be a hacker but growing up my dream also got a word added, which is, &ldquo;Ethical&rdquo; cause i don&rsquo;t wanna end up in jail and secondly the security industry is on BOOM. I know AI is very much in the IT space right now but someone has to secure the slop created by AI ðŸ¤–</p>]]></description>
